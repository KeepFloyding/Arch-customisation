# README

Storing config files for a personalised Arch experience. A lot of material comes from different sources such as Arch labs so huge kudos to them for a great dark theme.
Just made some modifications to the following modules:

* tint2 for panel
* xfce4 terminal (used the same configuration as Arco Linux with some small mods)
* rofi (powerful application search functionality; contains modules such as drun, window and a file browser)
* redshift (turning screen red so that it is easier on the eyes
* zsh (shell setup)
* Thunar (file manager)
* openbox (window manager; contains key bindings and desktop switching)
* Conky (system stats)
* Nitrogen (for background pictures)
* fontconfig (fonts I assume?)
* jgmenu (using this instead of the openbox menu)
* dunst (notification stuff)

And some other stuff in here as well.

* autostart (modules to autostart)
* run_rofi (a shell command to run rofi when pressing the windows key)
